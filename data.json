For those that called for me and  transgressed against me and want me murdered. I forgive you. I truly do. I have  been blessed God these three to four years. Something was brought about by  courageous men of God to make something beautiful. I learned grace. I learned  forgiveness. I learned love, I learned to look at others with love no matter  who they are. I have learned there is no redemption above forgiveness. Like  Abraham Lincoln said once that mercy bears richer fruits than any other  attributes. I pray one day the message of the lord would be heard because the  world is hurting, and things could be better. I don't know what else to say. To  my family, I'm good, I'm strong just know that I'm going to be okay. I'm good.  I love y\u2019all. I love y\u2019all I truly do. I will see y\u2019all in the other world. I'm  ready warden.

You know what it is girl, love ya. Maurie, appreciate it girl. Much love to you all. Mrs. Cox, love you. Momma, you are my hero. I wish this world was just like you. Another mother got hurt, as a parent I understand the pain. That letter she wrote wasn't wrong, she was just hurting. She showed God's love for letting me know that love will be there to welcome me home. I love you all. I don't know what you are going to feel after tonight. I love you. I pray one day we will all meet in heaven. A man told me 11 years ago the hardest thing to say is, \"I forgive you.\" Hope one day we all be together again.

I love my children, Roxanne, Roseanne, Melissa, and Louis. I miss them; I will take them with me in my heart. I will keep them in my heart.

Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed by thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen. Lord Jesus forgive of my sins, please forgive me for the sins that I can remember.",
